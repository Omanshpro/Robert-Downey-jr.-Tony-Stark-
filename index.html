        <p>Robert Downey Jr. is an American actor known for roles in a wide variety of films, including 'Iron Man,' 'The Avengers, 'Sherlock Holmes' and 'Chaplin.'<br>
            Born in New York City on April 4, 1965, Robert Downey Jr. began acting as a young child. He made his first film appearances and was a cast member on Saturday Night Live in the 1980s, but his growing success was marred by years of struggles with drug abuse.
